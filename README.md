# Introduction 
Homogenization technique provides the effective properties effective properties 
of a hetergenous material based on the mechanical properties of its microstrcut.
In numerical homogenization, by applying six orthogonal strain tensors over the 
representetive volume element (RVE) of the material, the sttiffness tenosr Cijkl
is computed by a vlume integration of the micro-stress and micro-strain. 
The microstrures should consist of all hetergenousiry (crack, fiber, prosity, etc)


Numerical homogenization provides the effective properties of a hetergenous
material. $\sigma_{ij}=C_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{kl}$
